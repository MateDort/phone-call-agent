1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure environment:**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

**Required in `.env`:**
```env
# Twilio (Required)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Webhook URLs (Required)
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-url.ngrok.io
WEBHOOK_PORT=5000
WEBSOCKET_PORT=5001

# Gemini (Required)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_VOICE=Kore  # Options: Kore, Puck, Charon
